# Exercise 2: Publish-Subscribe

**Important: Before attempting the exercise, please ensure you have followed [the instructions for preparing your machine](/README.md#preparing-your-machine-for-the-workshop) and that you have read [the instructions for running the exercise solutions](/README.md#running-the-exercise-solutions).**

NServiceBus endpoints communicate by sending each other messages. In this exercise, we'll focus on a specific type of messages: events. We will also explore a very powerful and popular messaging pattern: Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub).

Events are used to communicate that some action has taken place. They're informing us of a fact that something occurred in the past. In Pub-Sub, the sender (called Publisher) and the receiver (called Subscriber) are loosely coupled. There might be zero, one or multiple Subscribers interested in a specific event. In order to receive that event, they need to explicitly subscribe to it. In NServiceBus a subscription request is handled by the framework, together with message mappings and implementions of handlers which will process the event. The Publisher sends a copy of the event message to each subscriber.

## Overview

In the last exercise you extended the UI by showing additional information. For this exercise, the Orders page has a new button, "Create new order". In this exercise, we'll complete the process of placing a new order.

## Business requirements

When a customer creates a new order, that information is stored in a database. In order to complete the process, you need to provide the ability to pay for the placed order.

## What's provided for you

- Have a look at the `EndpointConfig` class in the `Divergent.Finance` project. Note that we use conventions to specify which messages are events:

  ```c#
  conventions.DefiningEventsAs(t =>
      t.Namespace != null &&
      t.Namespace.StartsWith("Divergent") &&
      t.Namespace.EndsWith("Events") &&
      t.Name.EndsWith("Event"));`
  ```

  If you create a class inside a namespace ending with "Events", and the name of this class ends with "Event", then NServiceBus will know it's an event.

- In the `Divergent.Finance/PaymentClient` directory you'll find a provided implementation for handling payments, named `ReliablePaymentClient`.


## Exercise 2.1: create and publish an `OrderSubmittedEvent`

In this exercise you'll create a new event named `OrderSubmittedEvent`. This event will be published by `SubmitOrderHandler` in the `Divergent.Sales` project.

### Step 1

Have a look at the following classes: `Customer` in `Divergent.Customers.Data.Models`, `Order` and `Product` in `Divergent.Sales.Data.Models`.

### Step 2

In the `Divergent.Sales.Messages` project, in the directory `Events`, add a new class called `OrderSubmittedEvent.cs`. The class should have three properties with public setters and getters: Id of the order, Id of the customer, and the list of product Ids.

```c#
namespace Divergent.Sales.Messages.Events
{
    public class OrderSubmittedEvent
    {
        public int OrderId { get; set; }
        public int CustomerId { get; set; }

        public List<int> Products { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Step 3

Have a look at `SubmitOrderHandler` class in the `Divergent.Sales` project. At the end of the `Handle` method, publish the `OrderSubmittedEvent`, by calling the ```context.Publish<OrderSubmittedEvent>()``` method. Copy the properties from the incoming `SubmitOrderCommand` message, to the properties of the event.

```c#
await context.Publish<OrderSubmittedEvent>(e =>
{
    e.OrderId = order.Id;
    e.CustomerId = message.CustomerId;
    e.Products = message.Products;
});
```

## Exercise 2.2: handle `OrderSubmittedEvent` in Shipping, Finance and Customers

In this exercise, you'll handle the `OrderSubmittedEvent` by logging the information in the `OrderSubmittedHandler` class in `Divergent.Shipping` project and in the `OrderSubmittedHandler` class in `Divergent.Sales` project. Then you'll extend the handler implementation in the `Divergent.Finance` project, in order to process the payment using the provided `GetAmount()` method and the `ReliablePaymentClient` class.

### Step 1

Create the `OrderSubmittedHandler` class in the `Divergent.Shipping` project, inside the `Handlers` namespace.

### Step 2

The `OrderSubmittedHandler` should process the `OrderSubmittedEvent` published by `Divergent.Sales`. In order to handle this event implement the `IHandleMessages<OrderSubmittedEvent>` interface in the `OrderSubmittedHandler` class.

### Step 3

In the `Divergent.Shipping` project, configure the publisher for the `OrderSubmittedEvent`. To do this use the `routing` object obtained when configuring the transport and add the following statement

```
routing.RegisterPublisher(typeof(OrderSubmittedEvent), "Divergent.Sales");
```

### Step 4

Add the code in the handler to create a new shipment entity if one does not exist for a given order. Set the `IsOrderSubmitted` flag to indicate an order has been submitted.

```c#
namespace Divergent.Shipping.Handlers
{
    public class OrderSubmittedHandler : IHandleMessages<OrderSubmittedEvent>
    {
        private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger<OrderSubmittedHandler>();

        public async Task Handle(OrderSubmittedEvent message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            using (var db = new ShippingContext())
            {
                var shipment = await db.Shipments.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.OrderId == message.OrderId);
                if (shipment == null)
                {
                    shipment = new Shipment
                    {
                        OrderId = message.OrderId
                    };
                    db.Shipments.Add(shipment);
                }
                shipment.IsOrderSubmitted = true;
                await db.SaveChangesAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5

Create an `OrderSubmittedHandler` class in the `Divergent.Finance` project, inside the `Handlers` namespace.

### Step 6

The `OrderSubmittedHandler` should also process the `OrderSubmittedEvent` published by `Divergent.Sales`. In order to handle this implement the `IHandleMessages<OrderSubmittedEvent>` interface in the `OrderSubmittedHandler` class.

### Step 7

In the `Divergent.Finance` project, configure the publisher for the `OrderSubmittedEvent`. To do this use the `routing` object obtained when configuring the transport and add the following statement

```
routing.RegisterPublisher(typeof(OrderSubmittedEvent), "Divergent.Sales");
```


### Step 8

When Finance receives the `OrderSubmittedEvent` message it needs to keep track of item prices that belong to the submitted order. And finally initiate the payment process by sending the `InitiatePaymentProcessCommand` message.

```c#
namespace Divergent.Finance.Handlers
{
    public class OrderSubmittedHandler : IHandleMessages<OrderSubmittedEvent>
    {
        private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger<OrderSubmittedHandler>();

        public async Task Handle(OrderSubmittedEvent message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            Log.Info("Handle OrderSubmittedEvent");

            double amount = 0;
            using (var db = new FinanceContext())
            {
                var query = from price in db.Prices
                            where message.Products.Contains(price.ProductId)
                            select price;

                foreach (var price in query)
                {
                    var op = new OrderItemPrice()
                    {
                        OrderId = message.OrderId,
                        ItemPrice = price.ItemPrice,
                        ProductId = price.ProductId
                    };

                    amount += price.ItemPrice;

                    db.OrderItemPrices.Add(op);
                }

                await db.SaveChangesAsync();
            }

            await context.SendLocal(new InitiatePaymentProcessCommand()
            {
                CustomerId = message.CustomerId,
                OrderId = message.OrderId,
                Amount = amount
            });
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 9

In the `Divergent.Finance` project create the `InitiatePaymentProcessCommandHandler` class inside the `Handlers` namespace in order to handle the payment process.

```c#
namespace Divergent.Finance.Handlers
{
    public class InitiatePaymentProcessCommandHandler : IHandleMessages<InitiatePaymentProcessCommand>
    {
        private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger<InitiatePaymentProcessCommand>();
        private readonly ReliablePaymentClient _reliablePaymentClient;

        public InitiatePaymentProcessCommandHandler(ReliablePaymentClient reliablePaymentClient)
        {
            _reliablePaymentClient = reliablePaymentClient;
        }

        public async Task Handle(InitiatePaymentProcessCommand message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            Log.Info("Handle InitiatePaymentProcessCommand");

            await _reliablePaymentClient.ProcessPayment(message.CustomerId, message.Amount);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 10

In the `Divergent.Customers` project create the `OrderSubmittedHandler` class inside the `Handlers` namespace in order to keep track of which orders have been submitted by which customer.

```c#
namespace Divergent.Customers.Handlers
{
    public class OrderSubmittedHandler : IHandleMessages<OrderSubmittedEvent>
    {
        private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger<OrderSubmittedHandler>();
    
        public async Task Handle(OrderSubmittedEvent message, NServiceBus.IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            Log.Info("Handling: OrderSubmittedEvent.");
    
            using (var db = new CustomersContext())
            {
                var customer = await db.Customers
                    .Include(c=>c.Orders)
                    .SingleAsync(c=>c.Id == message.CustomerId);
    
                customer.Orders.Add(new Data.Models.Order()
                {
                    CustomerId = message.CustomerId,
                    OrderId = message.OrderId
                });
    
                await db.SaveChangesAsync();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 11

In the `Divergent.Customers` project, configure the publisher for the `OrderSubmittedEvent`. To do this use the `routing` object obtained when configuring the transport and add the following statement

```
routing.RegisterPublisher(typeof(OrderSubmittedEvent), "Divergent.Sales");
```

## Exercise 2.3: create and publish the `PaymentSucceededEvent`

In this exercise we'll create a new event called `PaymentSucceededEvent`. This event will be published by the `InitiatePaymentProcessCommandHandler` in the `Divergent.Finance` project.

### Step 1

In the `Divergent.Finance.Messages` project, in the directory `Events`, add a new class called `PaymentSucceededEvent.cs`. The class should have only a single property with a public setter and a getter: id of the order.

```c#
namespace Divergent.Finance.Messages.Events
{
    public class PaymentSucceededEvent
    {
        public int OrderId { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Step 2

At the end of `InitiatePaymentProcessCommandHandler`, publish the `PaymentSucceededEvent` by calling `context.Publish<PaymentSucceededEvent>()` method. Copy the order id from the incoming `InitiatePaymentProcessCommand` message, to the property of the event.

```c#
public async Task Handle(InitiatePaymentProcessCommand message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
{
    Log.Info("Handle InitiatePaymentProcessCommand");

    await _reliablePaymentClient.ProcessPayment(message.CustomerId, message.Amount);

    await context.Publish<PaymentSucceededEvent>(e =>
    {
        e.OrderId = message.OrderId;
    });
}
```

## Exercise 2.4: handle `PaymentSucceededEvent`

In this exercise we'll handle the `PaymentSucceededEvent` by logging the information in the `PaymentSucceededHandler` class in `Divergent.Shipping`.

### Step 1

Create the `PaymentSucceededHandler` class in the `Divergent.Shipping` project, in the `Handlers` namespace.

### Step 2

The `PaymentSucceededHandler` should process the `PaymentSucceededEvent` published by `Divergent.Finance`. In order to handle this event implement the `IHandleMessages<PaymentSucceededEvent>` interface in the `PaymentSucceededEvent` class.

### Step 3

Add the code in the handler to create a new shipment entity if one does not exist for a given order. Set the `IsPaymentProcessed` flag to indicate a payment has been processed.

```c#
namespace Divergent.Shipping.Handlers
{
    public class PaymentSucceededHandler : IHandleMessages<PaymentSucceededEvent>
    {
        private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger<PaymentSucceededHandler>();

        public async Task Handle(PaymentSucceededEvent message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            using (var db = new ShippingContext())
            {
                var shipment = await db.Shipments.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.OrderId == message.OrderId);
                if (shipment == null)
                {
                    shipment = new Shipment
                    {
                        OrderId = message.OrderId
                    };
                    db.Shipments.Add(shipment);
                }
                shipment.IsPaymentProcessed = true;
                await db.SaveChangesAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4

In the `Divergent.Shipping` project, configure the publisher for the `PaymentSucceededEvent`. To do this use the `routing` object obtained when configuring the transport and add the following statement

```
routing.RegisterPublisher(typeof(PaymentSucceededEvent), "Divergent.Finance");
```
